# New SReLU
The repo holds the implementation of SReLU based on the paper:
[Deep Learning with S-shaped Rectified Linear Activation Units](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07030)
[Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe) needs to be installed before using SReLU. 
An concrete example (train script, prototxt and solver files are included) is shown in [models/bvlc_googlenet](https://github.com/AIROBOTAI/caffe/tree/SReLU/models/bvlc_googlenet)

If you use SReLU in your research, please cite our paper:
